<h1>Hello Viewer,</h1>

The world of machine Learning has been advancing for at a very high space and it is helping us developing our current technologies by making it a possibility to let our programs analyse like humans.

Artificial Intelligence(A.I) has been one such application of machine Learning which has already started making our life easier like Google Assistant, Alexa etc. 

But all these AI and all need some data with them that can help us with all the predictions and detection.

This project is actually to detect object using one such model called <b>VGG16</b>

<h3>VGG16</h3>

VGG16 is a model that already has some set of Keras Layers created and arranged in a Sequence and is mostly tested model.

In this project I will be using the VGG 16 with the concept of Transfer Learning that will help me identify the
